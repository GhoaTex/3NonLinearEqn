Need help: How to solve 3 non-linear complex transcendental equations without  initial conditions


Attached is the problem I was having. I am trying to find the values for "alpha" which are supposed to be real and positive.
I have mainly tried fsolve which is way too sensitive to initial guesses and I haven't found a good way to get good initial guesses. I tried minimizing the residue of the three functions using "fmin" on the residue function FNM. That didn't work well either...
I am trying to see something akin to the attached curve except for an exponential growth beginning around 3.0....

x2plot is the x-axis of the plot and alpha would be the y-axis.
